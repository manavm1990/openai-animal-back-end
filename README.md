# Open AI Animal Naming Demo

## Back-End

To try this you need to have a [Open AI API Key](https://beta.openai.com/). Add it to a `.env` like this: `OPENAI_API_KEY=<your key>`.

Then run `npm i` and `npm run start`.

Get [the front-end](https://github.com/manavm1990/openai-demo-frontend) and run that in a separate terminal.

Give a ‚≠ê if you like it.
